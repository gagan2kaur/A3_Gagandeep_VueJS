> A Vue.js project This is a simple website for NZ Music Academy, built in Vue JS. I have used three Vue Components.

## Build Setup
You must have NodeJS, NPM and Vue installed. Once you download the code, go to the code folder in command line or bash and run the below two commands to run the Vue application locally (Dev Mode). Use the third command to build and distribute for hosting in production.
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
